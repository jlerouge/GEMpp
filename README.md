# GEM++ : a Graph Extraction and Matching C++ software

## Description
GEM++ is a framework designed to implement a binary linear programming approach of the graph edit distance and subgraph isomorphism, on directed or undirected attributed graphs. GEM++ enables attributes weighting for nodes and edges, and it provides both exact and approximated formulations for the resolution.
