GEM++ : Graph Extraction and Matching C++ toolkit

GEM++ provides graph matching functionalities implemented with binary programming, such as :
	* Graph Edit Distance (linear and quadratic programming), and some approximations :
		- lower bound (constraint aggregation)
		- upper bound (pruning of the branch & bound tree)
		- bipartite graph matching
	* Subgraph isomorphism, with several level of tolerance :
		- exact (no tolerance)
		- substitution-tolerant (label substitutions are allowed)
		- error-tolerant (topology errors and substitutions are allowed)

GEM++ is compatible with several mathematical solvers :
	- GLPK
	- Gurobi
	- Cplex

GEM++ has been developed by the LITIS laboratory (www.litislab.fr).
