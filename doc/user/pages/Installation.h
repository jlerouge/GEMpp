    First, you need to install some dependencies. You will need *git* to download the sources :

        sudo apt-get install git

    In order to compile the program, you will also need the Qt SDK (http://qt-project.org/downloads).
    GEM++ minimal requirement for Qt is version 5.2. Depending on your computer architecture,
    you can use 32-bit or 64-bit version of Qt.

    Then, you can download the latest sources from ... :

        cd /path/to/download/directory
        git clone http://.../GEM++.git
